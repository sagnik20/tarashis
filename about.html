					The sequel of this book <span class="highlight">Banglar Satipeethe Tantra Rahasyo Sandhane</span> is his 1st oncoming book.
				</p>
				<p>
					His second upcoming book is "<span class="highlight">Birahi Srikrishna</span>."
				</p>
				<p>
					The writing style of this respected YOGI author is marked by epigrammatic brevity, subtle humor, witty
					dialogues and terseness of expression, which are based upon his own philosophy of life. In all his books,
					the author's quest for the nector of spiritualism impresses us most. Each of his creation is different from
					the other with different background and topic. So, it's advisable not to compare one book with the other,
					since apple cannot be compared to orange.
				</p>
				<p>
					To conclude, if you're willing to realize the HINDU SPIRITUALISM you must read the above mentioned works of
					TARASHIS GANGOPADHYAY. He is without a doubt one of the most gifted authors on the planet at this time.
